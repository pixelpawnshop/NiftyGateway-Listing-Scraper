.\run_production.ps1
```

**Command Prompt**:
```cmd
.\run_production.bat
```

#### Option 2: Single Scan
```bash
# Activate environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run single scan with real-time Discord alerts
python src\production_scraper.py --max-items 0 --headless --max-scrolls 400
```

#### Option 3: Testing Mode
```bash
# Test with small batch to verify Discord notifications
python src\production_scraper.py --max-items 10 --max-scrolls 5
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `--max-items` | Max items to scan (0 = unlimited) | 0 | `--max-items 1000` |
| `--headless` | Run without browser window | False | `--headless` |
| `--max-scrolls` | Maximum scroll attempts | 50 | `--max-scrolls 400` |
| `--continuous` | Run continuously | False | `--continuous` |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Phase 1**: Aggressive scrolling to collect all collection URLs
- **Phase 2**: Sequential processing of each URL to extract floor price data
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automated Chrome browser interaction for NiftyGateway
- **Multiple Scroll Strategies**: Ensures maximum marketplace content discovery
- **Real-time Callbacks**: Instant notification system for time-sensitive opportunities

### Error Handling
- **Navigation Retries**: Failed page loads are retried automatically
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues scanning even if individual items fail
- **Webhook Resilience**: Discord notification failures don't stop the scanning process
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress and error reporting for debugging

### Anti-Detection Measures
- **Human-like Scrolling**: Multiple small scrolls to simulate user behavior
- **Random Delays**: Variable wait times between requests to appear natural
- **Standard User Agent**: Mimics regular Chrome browser interactions

## üìä Discord Notification Examples

The system sends rich Discord embeds with detailed arbitrage information:

### üî• RED FLAG Alert Example:
```
üî• EXCELLENT ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY üî•

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Discord webhook not working:**
```bash
# Test your webhook URL manually:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "Test message"}' YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

**No opportunities found:**
- Check internet connection and API availability
- Verify Discord webhook URL is valid
- Try reducing --max-items for testing

**Browser issues:**
- Update Chrome to latest version
- Use `--headless` for VPS deployment
- Check available system memory

**Rate limiting:**
- Built-in delays prevent most rate limiting
- If issues persist, increase scan intervals

**PowerShell Execution Policy Error**:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**ChromeDriver Issues**:
- The scraper auto-downloads compatible ChromeDriver
- Ensure Chrome browser is updated to latest version

**Memory Issues (Large Scans)**:
- Close other applications
- Use `--headless` flag to reduce memory usage
- Consider running on VPS for 24/7 monitoring

### Performance Optimization

**For Maximum Speed**:
- Use `--headless` flag
- Close unnecessary applications
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Use continuous mode for real-time monitoring

**For Maximum Reliability**:
- Use VPS deployment for 24/7 operation
- Monitor Discord channel for notification health
- Set appropriate scan intervals for your use case

## üìù Development

### Project Structure
The scanner is modular and extensible:
- **src/nifty_scraper.py**: Core scraping logic with real-time callbacks
- **src/production_scraper.py**: CLI interface for Discord alerts
- **src/discord_notifier.py**: Discord webhook client for rich notifications
- **src/opensea_offers_client.py**: Arbitrage analysis and opportunity detection
- **src/opensea_client.py**: Collection data enrichment

### Testing
```bash
# Test with small dataset and Discord notifications
python src\production_scraper.py --max-items 10 --max-scrolls 5

# Test continuous mode for short duration
python src\production_scraper.py --continuous --scan-interval 30 --max-items 50
```

### Adding New Features
- Extend arbitrage flagging logic in `opensea_offers_client.py`
- Customize Discord notification format in `discord_notifier.py`
- Add new command line options in `production_scraper.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Discord Notifications
- Set up your Discord webhook URL in the environment variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Test webhook connectivity before deploying for production
- Monitor notification frequency to avoid Discord rate limits

### Rate Limiting & API Usage
- Built-in delays prevent overwhelming NiftyGateway servers
- OpenSea API calls are rate-limited and cached when possible
- Use responsibly for legitimate arbitrage research purposes

### Real-Time Performance
- Notification speed depends on network latency and Discord response time
- Typical notification delay: < 5 seconds from opportunity discovery
- Consider VPS deployment near exchange servers for fastest alerts

### Data Accuracy
- Floor prices are extracted from the "List Price" column on NiftyGateway
- OpenSea offers reflect real bid data at time of scanning
- Price discrepancies may exist due to rapid market changes

### Legal Compliance
- This tool is for educational and arbitrage research purposes
- Ensure compliance with NiftyGateway and OpenSea terms of service
- Use scraped data responsibly and ethically
- Consider the legal implications of automated trading systems
